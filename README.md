Keras extention packages
========================

This package provide tips of keras extentions.

PartialConvND: PartialConvND(N=1~3) classes are implementation of  "Partial Convolutional based padding" which re-weight convolution near image borders based on the ratios between the padded area and the convolution sliding window area. this algorithm has been introduced by *Guilin Liu et al.* in https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11718
